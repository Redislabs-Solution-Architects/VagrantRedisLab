# VagrantRedisLab
Vagrant-based Redis lab

It is a work in progress yet. This automation is built around Vagrant and Virtualbox for home labs, but it will also be usable for Vagrant-less installations. You'll need Vagrant installed anyway (just 1G of your drive).

1. Run INIT.sh to initiate the env.
```
./INIT.sh
++ mkdir -p ./SHARED/_PROVISION
++ cat
++ tee ./SHARED/_PROVISION/README.txt
This is the temporary folder for all environment stuff. Do not modify anything here.
```
